    "# Logic Programming with the MARS Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the output of MARS is weighted confidences, we can make a logic program out of that. Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Validation step. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the probabilities of the rules and probabilities of edges, we can see how likely each proposed MoA is.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we can also try this on some of the repurposing suggestions. Let's say MARS suggested a drug-BP pair which wasn't in the test set along with an MoA. Let's plug it in to the logic program with its suggested MoAs as rules, and get a probability that it could be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of our output is weighted rules. It's cool for explainability, but how many ML researchers actually use them? We can show how to use them afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, let's say we propose a new drug which is not in the original KG, but we have the protein target. Now that we have weighted rules, we can:\n",
    "- query whether that drug targets a specific BP.\n",
    "- if we know which BP it targets, query for the most likely MoA, based on our rules."
